          <h2>First Woman Prime Minister of India (Iron Lady)</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi</b> 19 November 1917 – 31 October 1984 was an Indian politician and stateswoman who served as the third 
            prime minister of India from 1966 to 1977 and from 1980 until her assassination in 1984. She was India's first and, to date, only female 
            prime minister and a central figure of the Indian National Congress. Gandhi was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister 
            of India, and the mother of Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded her in office as the country's sixth prime minister. Furthermore, Gandhi's cumulative 
            tenure of 15 years and 350 days makes her the second-longest-serving Indian prime minister after her father.

            During Nehru's premiership from 1947 to 1964, Gandhi served as his hostess and accompanied him on his numerous foreign trips. In 1959, she played 
            a part in the dissolution of the Communist-led Kerala state government as then-president of the Indian National Congress, otherwise a ceremonial 
            position to which she was elected earlier that year. Lal Bahadur Shastri, who had succeeded Nehru as prime minister upon his death in 1964, appointed 
            her minister of information and broadcasting in his government; the same year she was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament. 
            On Shastri's sudden death in January 1966, Gandhi defeated her rival Morarji Desai in the Congress Party parliamentary leadership election to become leader, 
            and thus also succeeded Shastri as prime minister. She led the Congress to victory in two subsequent elections, starting with the 1967 general election, in which 
            she was first elected to the Lok Sabha. Following the 1977 general election, Gandhi was ousted from office and even lost her seat in parliament. Nevertheless, her 
            faction of the Congress party won the next general election by a landslide, thanks in part to Gandhi's charismatic leadership in opposition to Janata Party rule, the 
            first non-Congress government in independent modern India's history.
